            <div class="info">
                Spider-Man, comic-book character who was the original everyman superhero. In Spider-Man’s 
                first story, in Marvel Comics’ Amazing Fantasy, no. 15 (1962), American teenager Peter Parker,
                a poor sickly orphan, is bitten by a radioactive spider. As a result
                of the bite, he gains superhuman strength, speed, and agility along with the ability to cling to walls. 
                Writer Stan Lee and illustrator Steve Ditko created Spider-Man as a filler story for a canceled anthology series. 
                At the time, a teenage lead hero was unheard of in comic books. However, young readers responded powerfully to 
                Peter Parker, prompting an ongoing title and, ultimately, a media empire, including video games, several animated 
                and one live-action television series, a live-action film franchise, and a Broadway musical.
